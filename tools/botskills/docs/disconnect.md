# Disconnect a Skill from your Virtual Assistant

The `disconnect` command allows you to disconnect a Skill from your Virtual Assistant. You can always check the Skills already connected to your Virtual Assistant using the [`list` command](./list.md). Remember to specify the coding language of your Virtual Assistant using `--cs` or `--ts`.

> **Tip:** It's highly advisable to execute this command from the **root folder of your Virtual Assistant bot**, so if you are using the suggested folder structure from the Templates, you may omit most of the optional arguments, as they default to the expected values from the Template's folder structure.

The basic command to disconnect a Skill from your Virtual Assistant:

```bash
botskills disconnect [option]
```
