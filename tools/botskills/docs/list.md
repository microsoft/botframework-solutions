# Listing connected Skills

The `list` command allows you to acknowledge the Skills currently connected to your assistant.

> **Tip:** It's highly advisable to execute this command from the **root folder of your assistant bot**, so if you are using the suggested folder structure from the Templates, you may ommit most of the optional arguments, as they default to the expected values from the Templates' folder structure.

The basic command to list the Skills connected to your assistant:
```bash
botskills list [options]
```
