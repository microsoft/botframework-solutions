# Experimental Skills

## Overview

Experimental Skills are early prototypes of Skills to help bring skill concepts to life for demonstrations and proof-of-concepts along with providing different examples to get you started.

These skills by their very nature are not complete, will likely have rudimentary language models, limited language support and limited testing hence are located in a experimental folder to ensure this is understood before you make use of them.

## Restaurant Booking Skill

The [Restaurant Booking](../src/csharp/experimental/skills/restaurantbooking/readme.md) skill provides a simple restaurant booking experience guiding the user through booking a table and leverages Adaptive Cards throughout to demonstrate how Speech, Text and UX can be combined for a compelling user experience. No integration to restaurant booking services exists at this time so is simulated with static data for testing purposes.
