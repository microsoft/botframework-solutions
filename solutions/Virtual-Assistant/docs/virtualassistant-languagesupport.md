# Virtual Assistant Language Support

## Overview

Natural Language Understanding is at the core of a Virtual Assistant. The LUIS Cognitive Service is used throughout the Virtual Assistant and Skills hence you can refer to the [LUIS supported languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-supported-languages) to understand the foundational language availability at this time.

In-line with customer prioritisation we have prioritised English, French, Italian, German,  Spanish and Chinese languages for the language models made available through the Virtual Assistant along with the Language Generation (responses). Additional language support is in planning and can be prioritised according to customer demand.
