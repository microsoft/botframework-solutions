# Primer Layout

> Primer’s layout includes basic page containers and a single-tiered, fraction-based grid system. That sounds more complicated than it really is though—it’s just containers, rows, and columns.

This repository is a module of the full [primer][primer] repository.

## Usage

The source files included are written in [Sass][sass] (`scss`) You can simply point your sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```scss
@import "primer-layout/index.scss";
```

You can also import specific portions of the module by importing those partials from the `/lib/` folder. _Make sure you import any requirements along with the modules._

## Build

For a compiled **css** version of this module, a npm script is included that will output a css version to `build/build.css` The built css file is also included in the npm package.

```
$ npm run build
```
