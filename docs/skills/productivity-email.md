### Example Skill Registration Entry

{
    "Name": "Email",
    "DispatcherModelName": "l_Email",

    "Assembly": "EmailSkill.EmailSkill, EmailSkill, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral",

    }
}
```

### Deploying the Skill in local-mode

The Email skill is added by default when deploying the Virtual Assistant, however if you want to install as a standalone bot for development/testing following the steps below.

Run this PowerShell script from the Email skill directory to deploy shared resources and LUIS models.

```
  pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File DeploymentScripts\deploy_bot.ps1
```

You will be prompted to provide the following parameters:
   - Name - A name for your bot and resource group. This must be **unique**.
   - Location - The Azure region for your services (e.g. westus)
   - LUIS Authoring Key - Refer to [this documentation page](../virtual-assistant/gettingstarted.md) for retrieving this key.

The msbot tool will outline the deployment plan including location and SKU. Ensure you review before proceeding.

> After deployment is complete, it's **imperative** that you make a note of the .bot file secret provided as this will be required for later steps. The secret can be found near the top of the execution output and will be in purple text.

- Update your `appsettings.json` file with the newly created .bot file name and .bot file secret.
- Run the following command and retrieve the InstrumentationKey for your Application Insights instance and update `InstrumentationKey` in your `appsettings.json` file.

```
msbot list --bot YOURBOTFILE.bot --secret YOUR_BOT_SECRET
```

```
  {
    "botFilePath": ".\\YOURBOTFILE.bot",
    "botFileSecret": "YOUR_BOT_SECRET",
    "ApplicationInsights": {
      "InstrumentationKey": "YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY"
    }
  }
```

- Finally, add the .bot file paths for each of your language configurations

```
"defaultLocale": "en-us",
  "languageModels": {
    "en": {
      "botFilePath": ".\\LocaleConfigurations\\YOUR_EN_BOT_PATH.bot",
      "botFileSecret": ""
    }
    }
```

Once you have followed the deployment instructions above, open the provided .bot file with the Bot Framework Emulator.
