# How To: Update deployment scripts

Once you have created your Virtual Assistant or Skill projects using the various templates and generators, you may need to update the deployment scripts to reflect ongoing changes to these scripts over time. 

## Sample Project

For each of the template types we provide a sample project which is generated by the most recent template. This enables you to easily retrieve changes such as the deployment scripts. Alternatively you can clone the repro and use this sample project as your starting point.

See the table below for a direct link to the appropriate sample project for your scenario:

Name | Language | Sample Project Location | Deployment Scripts Folder |
-------- | ---- | ----- | ----- 
Virtual Assistant | csharp | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/csharp/Sample) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/csharp/Sample/VirtualAssistantSample/Deployment)
Virtual Assistant | typescript | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/typescript/samples/sample-assistant) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/typescript/samples/sample-assistant/deployment)
Skill Template | csharp | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Skill-Template/csharp/Sample) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Skill-Template/csharp/Sample/SkillSample/Deployment)
Skill Template | typescript | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/typescript/samples/sample-skill) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/typescript/samples/sample-skill/deployment)

## Updating your deployment scripts

GitHub doesn't provide the ability to download folders or files interactively in the Web Browser. You must therefore clone the [Bot Framework Solutions repo](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions) onto your machine.

1. Clone the repo locally onto your machine 
2. Browse to the appropriate deployment scripts folder using the table above as a reference to the location
3. Copy the entire contents of the `Deployment` folder (resources and script subdirectories) over the files in the `Deployment` folder of your Assistant or Skill project.

You now have the latest scripts for Assistant/Skill deployment and updating of cognitive models.

## Skills

Skills are part of the above GitHub repo so any changes to the deployment scripts will be reflected automatically when you pull the latest changes.
