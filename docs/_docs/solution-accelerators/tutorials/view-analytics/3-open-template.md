1. After loading the tables with your populated data, you should now see insights from your Virtual Assistant.

*Note: You may run into authentication issues when opening the template, particularly if you have opened the template previously using another Application ID. If so, perform the following steps to re-authenticate the template with your Application Insights service:*

1. Open the Template
2. File > Options and Settings > Data Source Settings
3. Click "Global permissions"
4. Click on anything resembling "api.logalytics.io" and Clear Permissions > Clear Permissions > Delete
5. Close and Re-open the Template
6. Paste your Application Insights AppId
7. Click Load
8. *Important*: Select Organizational Account > Sign In > Connect

## Additional Telemetry

By default, a Virtual Assistant or Skill template based project doesn't collect personally identifiable information (e.g. Conversation drill-down and transcripts) which will lead to the respective sections in the PowerBI dashboard to not show information. If you wish to collect this information make the following change to `Startup.cs`

Change this entry:

```csharp
    services.AddSingleton<TelemetryLoggerMiddleware>();
```

To the following:

```csharp
    services.AddSingleton<TelemetryLoggerMiddleware>(s=>new TelemetryLoggerMiddleware(s.GetService<IBotTelemetryClient>(), true));
```
