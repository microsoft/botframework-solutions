The [**EventProducer**]({{site.repo}}) project is a console application that sends a sample message to your **Event Hubs Instance**.

### Create an Event Hubs Instance resource
1. In your **Event Hub Namespace** resource, navigate to **Entities** > **Event Hubs**
1. Select **+ Event Hub**, provide a name and select **Create**
    - Make note of the **Event Hub Name** for later
1. In your **Event Hubs Instance** resource, navigate to **Settings** > **Shared access policies**
1. Select **+ Add**, provide a name and select **Create**
    - Make note of the **Connection string-primary key** for later

### Configure the Event Producer project
Update the **appSettings.json** with the values collected in the last step, as well as a random user id that you will use to test against later.
