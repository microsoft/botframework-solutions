1. Select the option to add an artifact, this will show different options to manage the configuration like:
 - Project
 - Name
 - Specific artifact (*Note: you can only select one after a build pipeline has been successfully executed)

1. After the artifact is selected, configure the deployment stage.

1. In this case to verify the functionality of release configuration, we added an example task to check if the release configuration works without problems and verify the artifact configuration was compressed successfully in the build pipeline with the project information.
