### Purpose

Creating a [Bot Framework Skill]({{site.baseurl}}/overview/skills) through the [Skill template]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/csharp/create-skill/1_intro) is the easiest way to get started with creating a new Skill. If you have an existing v4 based Bot, we  recommended you take the resulting project from this template and copy over across your custom dialogs to get started quickly.

If you want to manually update your existing bot into a Bot Framework Skill, you can continue below.
