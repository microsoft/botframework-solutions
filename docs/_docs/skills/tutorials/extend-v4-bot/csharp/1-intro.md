### Purpose

Creating a Bot Framework Bot through the Virtual Assistant template is the easiest way to get started with using Skills. If you have an existing v4 based Bot, one recommended approach would be to take the resulting project from this template and bring across your custom dialogs to get started quickly.

Alternatively you can follow [these](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/skill-implement-consumer?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=cs) instructions to add Skill support to an existing Bot.
