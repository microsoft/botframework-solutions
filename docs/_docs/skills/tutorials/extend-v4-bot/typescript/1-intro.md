### Purpose

Creating a Bot Framework Bot through the Virtual Assistant template is the easiest way to get started with using Skills. If you have an existing v4 based Bot, the recommended approach would be to take the resulting project from this template and bring across your custom dialogs to get started quickly.

### Prerequisites

### Time to Complete

10 minutes

### Scenario

Enable Skills on an existing v4 bot.
