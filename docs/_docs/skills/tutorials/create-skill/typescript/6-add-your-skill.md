## Validate the Skill manifest endpoint

- To validate your Skill is deployed and working open up a browser window and navigate to your deployed Skill manifest (`/api/skill/manifest endpoint`). e.g.  `http://localhost:3978/api/skill/manifest`

## Adding your skill to an assistant

To add your new Skill to your assistant we provide the `botskills` command line tool to automate the process of adding the skill to your dispatch model and creating authentication connections where needed. 

Run the following command from a command prompt **within the directory of your assistant/Bot**. 

```bash
botskills connect --remoteManifest "http://<YOUR_SKILL_MANIFEST>.azurewebsites.net/api/skill/manifest" --luisFolder "<YOUR-SKILL_PATH>\Deployment\Resources\LU" --languages "en-us" --cs
```
