1. Install the [Skill Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BotBuilder.BotSkillTemplate). *Note that Visual Studio on Mac doesn't support VSIX packages, instead [clone the Skill Template sample from our repository](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Skill-Template/csharp/Sample).*
