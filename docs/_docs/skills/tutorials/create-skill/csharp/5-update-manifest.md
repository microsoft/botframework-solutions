A default manifest describing your Skill is provided as part of the project, you can find this within the `wwwroot\manifest` folder. Following deployment this requires updating with the deployment URL and Azure AD Application ID. `manifest-1.0` is provided for Power Virtual Agent support only, you should use `manifest-1.1` for Virtual Assistant scenarios.

1. Update `{YOUR_SKILL_URL}` with the URL of your deployed Skill endpoint, this must be prefixed with https.

1. Update `{YOUR_SKILL_APPID}` with the Active Directory AppID of your deployed Skill, you can find this within your `appSettings.json` file.

1. Publish the changes to your Skill endpoint and validate that you can retrieve the manifest using the browser (`/manifest/manifest-1.1.json`)
