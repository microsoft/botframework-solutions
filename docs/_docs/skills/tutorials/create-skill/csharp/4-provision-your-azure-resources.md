The Skill Template requires the following dependencies for end to end operation which are created through an ARM script which you can modify as required.

- Azure Web App
- Azure Storage Account (Transcripts)
- Azure Application Insights (Telemetry)

> Review the pricing and terms for the services and adjust to suit your scenario.

1. Open **PowerShell Core** (pwsh.exe)
1. Change to the **project directory** of your skill.
1. Run the following command to login to Azure:
    ```shell
    az login
    ```
1. If you have multiple subscriptions on your Azure account, [change the active subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest#change-the-active-subscription) to the subscription you wish to deploy your Azure resources to.
2. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    ./Deployment/Scripts/deploy.ps1
    ```
