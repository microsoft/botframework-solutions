### Purpose

In the Bot Framework 4.7 release, the Bot Framework Skills capability was transitioned into a core part of the core SDK and reached the General Availability (GA) milestone. Existing Virtual Assistant and Skill Template projects built using Bot Builder packages 4.6.2 and below need to be migrated in order to use this new approach. With the 4.7 skill protocol, any bot can become a skill without adapter changes hence the simplification that was achieved.

> At this time, this guidance is for customers seeking to leverage existing Bot Framework Skills for Power Virtual Agent based scenarios. Virtual Assistant scenarios can leverage this update to Skills in the next release.

### Prerequisites

- An existing Bot Framework Skill built from using Skill Template v4.6.0.1 and below.
- Review the `Dialogs\MainDialog.cs` file. If `MainDialog` derives from `RouterDialog` rather than `ActivityHandlerDialog` follow [these instructions](https://aka.ms/bfvarouting) to reflect dialog routing changes made in the last release.

### Steps

1. Update the Bot Framework SDK version to `4.7.0` for the Skill project

    In the latest Skill Template, the version of the BotBuilder libraries will be 4.6.2 or below. These need to be updated to 4.7.1. The easiest way to do this is right click the Solution and choose `Edit Project File` and replace with the fragment below. The accompanying test project also needs one library version update.

    ```xml
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.Luis" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.ApplicationInsights" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Azure" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Integration.ApplicationInsights.Core" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Integration.AspNet.Core" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Configuration" Version="4.7.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Bot.Schema" Version="4.7.1" />
    ```

    > Please note that `Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Solutions` library version 4.6.0 is compatible with BotBuilder 4.7.1.

1. Update BotController.cs

    Within your Skill project, `Controller\BotController.cs` implements `SkillController` which includes capabilities of standing up new APIs for skill invocation. This requirement has now been removed, therefore a default controller can now be used.

    Change the `BotController.cs` as shown below:

    ```csharp
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Bot.Builder;
    using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Integration.AspNet.Core;

    namespace {YourSkill}.Controllers
    {
        [Route("api/messages")]
        [ApiController]
        public class BotController : ControllerBase
        {
            private readonly IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter _adapter;
            private readonly IBot _bot;

            public BotController(IBotFrameworkHttpAdapter httpAdapter, IBot bot)
            {
                _adapter = httpAdapter;
                _bot = bot;
            }

            [HttpPost]
            [HttpGet]
            public async Task PostAsync()
            {
                await _adapter.ProcessAsync(Request, Response, _bot);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Remove registrations in `Startup.cs`

    In the current Skill Template, there are registrations for classes that are no longer needed in the 4.7 Skill protocol. They should be removed from Startup.cs within your Skill project.

    Remove these lines:

    ```csharp
        services.AddTransient<SkillWebSocketBotAdapter, CustomSkillAdapter>();
        services.AddTransient<SkillWebSocketAdapter>();

        // Register WhiteListAuthProvider
        services.AddSingleton<IWhitelistAuthenticationProvider, WhitelistAuthenticationProvider>();
    ```

1. Remove CustomSkillAdapter.cs

    A custom adapter is no longer needed, you can therefore remove `Adapters\CustomSkillAdapter.cs` from your project.

1. Remove custom implementation of `IWhitelistAuthenticationProvider`

    If you have implemented your own class for the interface `IWhitelistAuthenticationProvider` instead of using the WhitelistAuthenticationProvider class from the Solutions lib this can be removed.

1. Add code to handle the `EndOfConversation` activity from parent bot

    In Skill invocation, a skill needs to handle an `EndOfConversation` activity in order to support cancellation for interruption scenarios at the parent bot level. This capability will be included in the next release of the `Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Solutions` package and eventually as part of the core Bot Builder SDK. For now, add these lines of code at the top of the `OnTurnAsync` handler in your `IBot` implementation class (within the Bots folder of your project) to handle the `EndOfConversation` activity:

    ```csharp
    var activity = turnContext.Activity;
    var dialogState = _conversationState.CreateProperty<DialogState>(nameof(DialogState));
    if (activity != null && activity.Type == ActivityTypes.EndOfConversation)
    {
        await dialogState.DeleteAsync(turnContext).ConfigureAwait(false);
        await _conversationState.ClearStateAsync(turnContext).ConfigureAwait(false);
        await _conversationState.SaveChangesAsync(turnContext, force: true).ConfigureAwait(false);
        return;
    }

    ```
    
    With this block of code, when your skill receives an EndOfConversation activity it will clear out the existing dialog state so the skill will be in a clean state ready for the next conversation.

1. Update to use `EndOfConversation` instead of Handoff when a conversation completed

    In the `OnDialogCompleteAsync` function of `MainDialog.cs`, instead of sending back a 'Handoff' activity, update it to be `EndOfConversation` inline with the new Skills changes. Replace the entire contents with the code below.
    
    ```csharp
    // Retrieve the prior dialogs result if provided to return on the Skill EndOfConversation event.
    ObjectPath.TryGetPathValue<object>(outerDc.Context.TurnState, TurnPath.LASTRESULT, out object dialogResult);

    var endOfConversation = new Activity(ActivityTypes.EndOfConversation)
    {
        Code = EndOfConversationCodes.CompletedSuccessfully,
        Value = dialogResult
    };

    await outerDc.Context.SendActivityAsync(endOfConversation, cancellationToken);
    await outerDc.EndDialogAsync(result);
    ```

1. Add code in the exception handler of the adapter to send an EndOfConversation activity back

    In the exception handler of the `DefaultAdapter` normally located in the `Adapters` folder, add code to send an `EndOfConversation` activity back to complete a conversation when exception happens:

    ```csharp
    OnTurnError = async (turnContext, exception) =>
    {
        // Send and EndOfConversation activity to the skill caller with the error to end the conversation
        // and let the caller decide what to do.
        var endOfConversation = Activity.CreateEndOfConversationActivity();
        endOfConversation.Code = "SkillError";
        endOfConversation.Text = exception.Message;
        await context.SendActivityAsync(endOfConversation);
        ...
    };

    ```

1. Keep using the MultiProviderAuthDialog (No action needed)

    In the previous model the parent bot (VA) is the responsible for performing OAuth tasks by acting on behalf of a skill thus ensuring a common, shared authentication experience across an assistant. With this new release, Skills can now perform their own authentication requests and still benefit from a shared trust boundary.

    The existing `MultiProviderAuthDialog` if used will automatically adapt to this change and no changes are required. As required you can switch to using the `OAuthPrompt` directly.

In order to update to the new Skill manifest schema and handle Action invocation follow steps 2 and 3 of this tutorial.
