## Edit default responses
Edit the MainResponses.json and SharedResponses.json files in the Responses folder to modify the default responses used by the template.

## Add additional responses
To add additional responses, create a new folder in the Responses directory, then copy the .tt and .json files from Responses/Sample. Rename the files to match your domain, and modify the json file as needed. Set the Build Action of the json files to `EmbeddedResource`. In the Build menu of Visual Studio, run "Transform All t4 templates" to generate the necessary .cs file. In startup, register your response class in the ResponseManager.
