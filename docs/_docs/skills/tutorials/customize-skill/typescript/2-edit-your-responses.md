## Edit default responses
Edit the MainResponses.json and SharedResponses.json files in the Responses folder to modify the default responses used by the template.

## Add additional responses
To add additional responses, create a new folder in the Responses directory, then copy the files from Responses/Sample. Rename the files to match your domain, then modify the json file as needed.
