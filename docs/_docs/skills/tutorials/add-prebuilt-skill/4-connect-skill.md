Once you've deployed your Skill you can now add it to your Assistant. 

To add your new Skill to your assistant/Bot we provide a [botskills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botskills) command line tool to automate the process of adding the Skill to your dispatch model and creating authentication connections where needed. 

Run the following command from a command prompt **within the directory of your assistant/Bot**. 

```bash
botskills connect --remoteManifest "https://<YOUR_SKILL_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/manifest/manifest-1.1.json" --cs
```

**Remember to re-publish your Assistant to Azure after you've added a Skill unless you plan on testing locally only**

See [Adding Skills]({{site.baseurl}}/skills/handbook/add-skills-to-a-virtual-assistant/) for more details.
