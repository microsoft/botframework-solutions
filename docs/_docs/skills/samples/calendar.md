## Configuration
{:.toc}

### Deployment
{:.no_toc}
Learn how to [provision your Azure resources]({{site.baseurl}}/skills/tutorials/create-skill/csharp/4-provision-your-azure-resources/) in the Create a Skill tutorial.

### Supported content providers
{:.no_toc}

> Office 365 and Outlook.com through the Microsoft Graph is supported along with support for Google accounts.

### Authentication connection settings
{:.no_toc}

#### Office 365

This skill uses the following authentication scopes:

- **User.ReadBasic.All**  
- **Calendars.ReadWrite**
- **People.Read**    
- **Contacts.Read**

You must use [these steps]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.data.urls.SkillManualAuth}}) to manually configure Authentication for the Calendar Skill. Due to a change in the Skill architecture this is not currently automated.

> Ensure you configure all of the scopes detailed above.

#### Google Account

To use a Google account follow these steps:
1. Enable Calendar API in [Google API library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
1. Create your calendar API credential in [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).
    1. Choose "Create credential" - "OAuth Client ID"
    1. Choose "Web Application"
    1. Set Redirect URL as **https://token.botframework.com/.auth/web/redirect**
1. Create an OAuth connection setting in your Web App Bot.
    - Connection name: **googleapi**
    - Service Provider: **Google**
    - Client id and secret are generated in step 2
    - Scopes: **https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts**.
1. Add the connection name, client id, secret and scopes in the **appsetting.json** file.

## Meeting Room Booking Support

The Calendar skill provides additional support to search and book meeting rooms. Due to search limitations in Microsoft Graph limiting the experience we leverage Azure Search to provide fuzzy meeting room name matching, floor level, etc. 

1. To simplify the process of extracting your meeting room data and inserting into Azure Search we have provided an example PowerShell script. However, you should ensure that `displayName`, `emailAddress`, `building` and `floorNumber` are populated within your Office 365 tenant (example below)). You can do this through the [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer/preview) using the query shown below, this information is required for the Meeting Room booking experience.

`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/places/microsoft.graph.room`
```json
{
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "94a7966e-b7f8-4466-b0c7-435251dab6eb",
            "displayName": "London ConfRoom Excalibur",
            "emailAddress": "Excalibur@ContosoVirtualAssist.onmicrosoft.com",
            "building": "4",
            "floorNumber": 2,
        },
        {
            "id": "45d9a9b4-ca7f-4cc5-aa50-f4a151bed172",
            "displayName": "London ConfRoom Enterprise",
            "emailAddress": "Enterprise@ContosoVirtualAssist.onmicrosoft.com",
            "building": "4",
            "floorNumber": 1
        },
    ]
}
```

2. Configure the settings of your registered app in the Azure App Registration portal
    - This app will request the permission for **Place.Read.All** scope. There are two ways to grant the consent:
      1. In API permissions, add a permission for **Place.Read.All** scope, and grant admin consent for your organization.
      2. Make sure your account has permission to access your tenant's meeting room data so that you can consent on behalf of your organization in the login step, testing the previous query will validate this.
    - In Authentication
      - Set "Treat application as a public client" as "Yes"
      - Set "Supported account types" according to your requirements

3. Run the following command to install the module:
```powershell
  Install-Module -Name CosmosDB
```
    
4. Run the following command:
```powershell
 ./Deployment/Scripts/enable_findmeetingroom.ps1
```
