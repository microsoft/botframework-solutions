### Authentication connection Settings
{:.no_toc}
If you plan to use the skill as part of a Virtual Assistant the process of registering a skill with your Virtual Assistant will create the supporting authentication connection information automatically for your Virtual Assistant. This skill uses the following authentication scopes which are registered automatically:
- **User.ReadBasic.All**
- **Mail.ReadWrite**
- **Mail.Send**
- **People.Read**
- **Contacts.Read**

**However**, if you wish to use the Skill directly without using a Virtual Assistant please use the following steps to manually configure Authentication for the Calendar Skill. This is **not** required when using the Skill with a Virtual Assistant.

Follow the general instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/skills/handbook/authentication/#manual-authentication) to configure this using the scopes shown above.
