The [Hospitality Skill]({{site.repo}}/tree/master/skills/csharp/experimental/hospitalityskill) demonstrates experiences that would be useful in a hospitality specific scenario, such as being able to check out of a hotel, ordering room service, and requesting hotel amenities. This skill does not integrate a hotel service at this time, and is instead simulated with static data for testing purposes.

This skill demonstrates the following scenarios:
- Show reservation: *What is my current check out date?*
- Extend reservation: *Can I extend my stay?*
- Request late check-out: *I want a late check out time* 
- Request amenities: *Can you bring me a toothbrush and toothpaste?*
- Room service: *I want to see a room service menu*
- Check out: *Can I check out now?*

An example transcript file demonstrating the Skill in action can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/transcripts/skills-hospitality.transcript), you can use the Bot Framework Emulator to open transcripts.
