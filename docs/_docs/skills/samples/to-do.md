### Supported content providers

### Authentication connection settings
{:.no_toc}

If you plan to use the skill as part of a Virtual Assistant the process of registering a skill with your Virtual Assistant will create the supporting authentication connection information automatically for your Virtual Assistant. This skill uses the following authentication scopes which are registered automatically:
- **Notes.ReadWrite** 
- **User.Read**
- **User.ReadBasic.All**
- **Tasks.ReadWrite**

**However**, if you wish to use the Skill directly without using a Virtual Assistant please use the following steps to manually configure Authentication for the Calendar Skill. This is **not** required when using the Skill with a Virtual Assistant.

Follow the general instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/skills/handbook/authentication/#manual-authentication) to configure this using the scopes shown above.

### Add customized to do lists
{:.no_toc}

If you want to add your customized list types, for example, your homework list or movie list, please follow these steps:

1. Add your list type to **appsettings.json**

	```json
	"customizeListTypes": [
	  "Homework",
	  "Movie"
	]
	```
2. Add your list type name and its synonym in `Responses/Shared/ToDoString.resx`

	Name | Value 
	---- | ----- 
	Homework | Homework 
	HomeworkSynonym | homework, home work 

3. Modify your LUIS file. Modify `Deployment/Resources/LU/en/todo.lu` so that your LUIS app can tell these new ListType entities. You can provide more utterance to make your LUIS model perform better.

	```diff
	## AddToDo
	+ - add {TaskContent=History} to my {ListType=homework} list
	+ - add {TaskContent=Math} to my {ListType=homework}
	```

	(Optional) If you want to support multiple languages, please modify corresponding `.resx` files and `.lu` files, such as `Deployment/Resources/LU/zh/todo.lu`.

	```diff
	## AddToDo
	+ - 在{ListType=作业}列表里加上{TaskContent=数学}
	```

	(Optional) After you add new list type, you can modify prompts as needed to make your conversation more friendly. For example, you can modify `Responses/Main/ToDoMainResponses.json`:

	```diff
	"ToDoWelcomeMessage": {
	    "replies": [
	      {
	+       "text": "Hi. I'm To Do bot. I can help you manage your To Do, Shopping, Grocery or Homework list."
	-       "text": "Hi. I'm To Do bot. I can help you manage your To Do, Shopping or Grocery list."
	      }
	    ]
	```

4. Redeploy your To Do Skill.
