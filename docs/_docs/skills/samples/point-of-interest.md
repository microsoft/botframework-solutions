This Skill supports an outgoing **OpenDefaultApp** Event Activity that provides a [Geo URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI_scheme) for chat clients to determine how to handle navigation to a user's selected point of interest.
The [Virtual Assistant Client (Android) sample]({{site.baseurl}}/clients-and-channels/clients/virtual-assistant-client) demonstrates how a client may navigate to a destination using a user's preferred map application.

```json
{ 
   "type":"event",
   "name":"OpenDefaultApp",
   "value":{ 
      "GeoUri":"geo:{LATITUDE},{LONGITUDE}"
   }
}
```
