The [Restaurant Booking skill](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-skills/tree/master/skills/csharp/experimental/restaurantbookingskill) provides a simple restaurant booking experience guiding the user through booking a table and leverages Adaptive Cards throughout to demonstrate how Speech, Text and UX can be combined for a compelling user experience. No integration to restaurant booking services exists at this time so is simulated with static data for testing purposes.

An example transcript file demonstrating the Skill in action can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/transcripts/skills-restaurantbooking.transcript), you can use the Bot Framework Emulator to open transcripts.
