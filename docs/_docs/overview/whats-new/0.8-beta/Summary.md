### Bot Framework 4.7 Support

The Virtual Assistant and Skill Templates have been updated to use the Bot Builder SDK v4.7 skills implementation. This marks the transition of Skills from Preview into GA as part of the core SDK. Skills are now supported across C#, Javascript/Typescript and Python with Java support to follow. 

Skills are the conversational component model for Bot Framework. Power Virtual Agents now has now added support for Skills through the new manifest schema.

All skills have been updated to the new v4.7 SDK skills implementation and have updated manifest files. The latest botskills CLI tool also provides support for the new manifest format.

### Deployment updates
{:.no_toc}

This release includes a number of updates and improvements to the Virtual Assistant and Skill deployment scripts. These changes include ARM template deployment of LUIS Authoring Keys, migrating to the consolidated Bot Framework CLI, and support for Azure US Government deployments. 

#### LUIS Authoring Resource ARM support
{:.no_toc}

The Virtual Assistant deployment now supports provisioning a LUIS Authoring Resource through ARM deployment. This removes the need to explicitly provide an authoring key during the deployment, and allows for RBAC on the resource enabling authoring keys to be shared by users of the same Azure subscription. 

#### Bot Framework CLI migration
{:.no_toc}

Work has begun on migrating from the deprecated Bot Builder Tools to the consolidated Bot Framework CLI. The QnA Maker, LUDown, and LuisGen commands have been converted in the deployment scripts, with support for LUIS coming in a subsequent release.

#### Azure US Government support
{:.no_toc}

This release enables the Virtual Assistant resources to be deployed in the Azure US Government Cloud. Support for Skills in Azure US Cloud will follow in a subsequent release.

For more guidance on how to deploy your Virtual Assistant to Azure US Government Cloud, refer to the following article:
- [Deploy Virtual Assistant to Azure US Cloud]({{site.baseurl}}//overview/whats-new/0.8-beta/azure-gov-deployment)

## Clients and Channels

{:.no_toc}
The Android client for the Virtual Assistant has been updated to support both [custom wake words](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-devices-sdk-create-kws) and authentication using the [Linked Accounts solution]({{site.baseurl}}/solution-accelerators/samples/linked-accounts/).
