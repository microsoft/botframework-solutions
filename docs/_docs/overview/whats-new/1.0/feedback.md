# 1.0 Release

## Current State of Feedback
The Feedback Middleware approach has been deprecated since the 0.8 release of **Microsoft.Bot.Solutions**. 
With the 1.0 release we have implemented a temporary feedback mechanism which is outlined [here](https://aka.ms/bfFeedbackDoc). We will have an 
incremental release in the near future with a more robust feedback implementation that will be a part of the **Microsoft.Bot.Solutions** library. 
As of now the **Microsoft.Bot.Solutions** library still contains the middleware solution but it is marked as deprecated and it will not work as 
desired due to the waterfall flow of the VA since the 0.8 release.
