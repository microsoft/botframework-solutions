This document describes the new features available in the **1.0 GA release** version of the Virtual Assistant across the following categories:
- Virtual Assistant and Skills

## Virtual Assistant and Skills
### Current State of Feedback
{:.no_toc}
The Feedback Middleware approach has been deprecated since the 0.8 release of **Microsoft.Bot.Solutions**. 
With the 1.0 release we have implemented a temporary feedback mechanism which is outlined [here](https://aka.ms/bfFeedbackDoc). We will have an 
incremental release in the near future with a more robust feedback implementation that will be a part of the **Microsoft.Bot.Solutions** library. 
As of now the **Microsoft.Bot.Solutions** library still contains the middleware solution but it is marked as deprecated and it will not work as 
desired due to the waterfall flow of the VA since the 0.8 release.

### Language Generation
{:.no_toc}
With the **1.0 GA release**, we are now utilizing Language Generation 4.8 Preview. As part of this, there are some breaking changes which may require you to update your .lg files to adhere to new syntax.

For full details regarding these breaking changes, please refer to the [Language Generation 4.8 Preview breaking changes](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/language-generation#48-preview).

### Single Sign-On for Skills
