## Adding Commands

An optional additional step is to add example commands that will help users understand what features your Assistant can perform. An example of this is shown below.

1. To add these, go back into the Manifest Editor and open the Application you previously created.
2. Click `Bots` in the left hand navigation.
3. Click `Add` under the Command section

4. Provide the utterance that Teams should send to your Assistant in the `Command text` box. A more friendly help text can then be provided in the `Help text` box. Choose `Personal` to only show this in 1:1 conversations.

5. Click Save and repeat for any other commands you wish to add.
6. Navigate to `Test and Distribute` to install your Virtual Assistant for testing or Download the Manifest zip file for distribution. You can click `Install` to repeat local testing.
