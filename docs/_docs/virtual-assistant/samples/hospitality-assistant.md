The [Hospitality Sample Virtual Assistant]({{site.repo}}/tree/master/samples/assistants/HospitalitySample) is a prototype of an assistant that helps to conceptualize and demonstrate how a virtual assistant could be used in a hospitality specific scenario. It also provides a starting point for those interested in creating an assistant customized for this scenario.

This sample works off the basis that the assistant would be integrated into a hotel room device and would help a hotel guest with anything they might usually go to the hotel concierge about. It also provides additional capabilites that might be useful for guests, such as getting the weather forecast or showing current news articles. 

The Hospitality Sample builds off of the [Virtual Assistant Template]({{site.baseurl}}/overview/virtualassistant) with the addition of a [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) knowledge base for answering common hotel FAQs and [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) customized for hospitality. It also connects 7 different skills, which are [Hospitality]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental/#hospitality-skill), [Event]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental/#event-skill), [Point of Interest]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/pointofinterest), [Weather]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental/#weather-skill), [Bing Search]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental/#bing-search-skill), [News]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental/#news-skill), and [Restaurant Booking]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental/#restaurant-booking-skill).

The majority of the skills connected to this sample are [experimental skills]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/skills/experimental), which means they are early prototypes of Skills and are likely to have rudimentary language models, limited language support and limited testing. These skills demonstrate a variety of skill concepts and provide great examples to get you started.
