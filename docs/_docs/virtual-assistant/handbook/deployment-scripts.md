## How do I reduce my Azure costs during development?
{:.no_toc}

The default `parameters.template.json` file is configured to use all free service tiers to reduce the cost of testing. Provide this file in the `-parametersFile` parameter on the `deploy.ps1` script. **Note: There are service limits associated with free tiers (e.g. Azure Search permits only 1 free tier per subscription). Free tiers should only be used for development, not for production implementations.**

## How do I customize my Azure resource deployment?
{:.no_toc}

Any of the following parameters in the ARM template can be overridden with your preferred values using the **parameters.template.json** file provided in the **Deployment/Resources** folder:

## How do I update my local deployment scripts with the latest?
{:.no_toc}
Once you have created your Virtual Assistant or Skill projects using the various templates and generators, you may need to update the deployment scripts to reflect ongoing changes to these scripts over time. 

### Sample Project
{:.no_toc}

For each of the template types we provide a sample project which is generated by the most recent template. This enables you to easily retrieve changes such as the deployment scripts. Alternatively you can clone the repro and use this sample project as your starting point.

See the table below for a direct link to the appropriate sample project for your scenario:

Name | Language | Sample Project Location | Deployment Scripts Folder |
-------- | ---- | ----- | ----- 
Virtual Assistant | csharp | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/samples/csharp/assistants/virtual-assistant) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/samples/csharp/assistants/virtual-assistant/VirtualAssistantSample/Deployment)
Virtual Assistant | typescript | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/typescript/samples/sample-assistant) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/Virtual-Assistant-Template/typescript/samples/sample-assistant/deployment)
Skill Template | csharp | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/samples/csharp/skill) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/typescript/samples/sample-assistant/deployment/scripts)
Skill Template | typescript | [Sample Project Location](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/typescript/samples/sample-skill) | [Deployment Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-solutions/tree/master/templates/typescript/samples/sample-skill/deployment/scripts)

### Updating your deployment scripts
{:.no_toc}

GitHub doesn't provide the ability to download folders or files interactively in the Web Browser. You must therefore clone the [Bot Framework Solutions repo]({{site.repo}}) onto your machine.

1. Clone the repo locally onto your machine 
1. Browse to the appropriate deployment scripts folder using the table above as a reference to the location
1. Copy the entire contents of the **Deployment** folder (resources and script subdirectories) over the files in the **Deployment** folder of your Assistant or Skill project.

You now have the latest scripts for Assistant/Skill deployment and updating of cognitive models.

### Skills
{:.no_toc}

Skills are part of the above GitHub repo so any changes to the deployment scripts will be reflected automatically when you pull the latest changes.


## How do I use my existing cognitive models (LUIS and/or QnA Maker) with a Virtual Assistant project?

If you would like to use an existing LUIS app or QnA Maker knowlege base with a Virtual Assistant project, please refer to the following steps.

### Use an existing QnA Maker knowledge base

If you have an existing QnA Maker knowledge base that you want to use in your Virtual Assistant project, follow these steps:

1. Add your knowledge base configuration in cognitivemodels.json
    ```
    "knowledgebases": [
      {
        "id": "mykb",
        "name": "<your-knowledge-base-name>",
        "kbId": "<your-knowledge-base-id>",
        "endpointKey": "<your-endpoint-key>",
        "hostname": "https://<your-qna-host>.azurewebsites.net/qnamaker",
        "subscriptionKey": ""
      }
    ]
    ```

    **KbId**, **endpointKey**, and **hostname** can be found in the Publish tab of the QnA Maker portal:

        POST /knowledgebases/<kbId>/generateAnswer
        Host: <hostname>
        Authorization: EndpointKey <endpointKey>
        Content-Type: application/json
        {"question":"<Your question>"}

1. Run the following command from your project directory to export the .qna schema of your knowledge base and update your Dispatch model and DispatchLuis.cs file:
    ```
    .\Deployment\Scripts\update_cognitive_model.ps1 -RemoteToLocal
    ```

1. Access your knowledge base in a Dialog using the following code (where "knowledgebase-id" is the id property from your cognitivemodels.json file):
    ```csharp
      var qnaDialog = TryCreateQnADialog("knowledgebase-id", localizedServices);
      if (qnaDialog != null)
      {
          Dialogs.Add(qnaDialog);
      }

      return await stepContext.BeginDialogAsync(knowledgebaseId, cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
    ```

### Use an existing LUIS model
If you have an existing LUIS application that you want to use in your Virtual Assistant project, follow these steps:

1. Add your LUIS app configuration in cognitivemodels.json:
    ```
    "languageModels": [
        {
          "id": "MyLuisApp",
          "name": "<your-luis-app-name>",
          "appid": "<your-luis-app-id>",
          "endpoint": "<your-luis-endpoint>",
          "authoringkey": "<your-luis-authoring-key>"
          "subscriptionkey": "<your-luis-subscription-key>",
          "region": "<your-luis-region>",
          "version": "0.1"
        }
      ],
    ```

    Each of the above properties can be found in the following locations:
     - Luis application name 
        - Navigate to the LUIS portal for your region (e.g. www.luis.ai for West US region)
        - Open the **Manage > Settings** tab
        - Copy the **App name** property
     - Luis application ID
        - Navigate to the LUIS portal for your region (e.g. www.luis.ai for West US region)
        - Open the **Manage > Settings** tab
        - Copy the **App ID** property
     - Luis endpoint
        - Navigate to the LUIS portal for your region (e.g. www.luis.ai for West US region)
        - Open the **Manage > Azure Resources > Authoring Resource** tab
        - For the assigned prediction resource, copy the **Endpoint URL** property
     - Luis authoring key
        - Navigate to the LUIS portal for your region (e.g. www.luis.ai for West US region)
        - Open the **Manage > Azure Resources > Authoring Resource** tab
        - For the assigned authoring resource, copy the **Primary Key** property
     - Luis subscription key
        - Navigate to the LUIS portal for your region (e.g. www.luis.ai for West US region)
        - Open the **Manage > Azure Resources > Authoring Resource** tab
        - For the assigned prediction resource, copy the **Primary Key** property
     - Luis region
        - Navigate to the LUIS portal for your region (e.g. www.luis.ai for West US region)
        - Open the **Manage > Azure Resources > Authoring Resource** tab
        - For the assigned authoring resource, copy the **Location** property

  1. Run the following command from your project directory to export the .lu schema of your LUIS model and update your Dispatch model and DispatchLuis.cs file:
      ```
      .\Deployment\Scripts\update_cognitive_model.ps1 -RemoteToLocal
      ```

  1. Access your LUIS model in a Dialog using the following code (where "luis-app-id" is the id property from your cognitivemodels.json file and YourLUIS.cs is the LUIS generation class created for your application):
      ```csharp
        // Get cognitive models for the current locale.
        var localizedServices = _services.GetCognitiveModels();

        // Run LUIS recognition on General model and store result in turn state.
        var luisResult = await localizedServices.LuisServices["luis-app-id"].RecognizeAsync<YourLUIS.cs>(innerDc.Context, cancellationToken);
      ```

## How do I add support for additional languages to my existing Virtual Assistant?
If you would like to add support for additional languages to your existing Virtual Assistant, please refer to the following steps.

1. Run the following command from your project directory. Replace "locale" with one or more of the supported language codes (en-us, it-it, de-de, es-es, fr-fr, or zh-cn). The values for the remaining parameters can be found in appsettings.json after Virtual Assistant deployment.

    ```
      .\Deployment\Scripts\deploy_cognitive_models.ps1 `
        -languages "locale" `
        -name 'base-name-of-luis-model' `
        -resourceGroup 'resouce-group-for-luis-resource' `
        -luisAuthoringRegion 'luis-authoring-region' `
        -luisAuthoringKey 'luis-authoring-key' `
        -luisAccountName 'luis-account-name' `
        -luisAccountRegion 'luis-account-region' `
        -luisSubscriptionKey 'luis-subscription-key' `
        -luisEndpoint 'luis-endpoint' `
        -qnaSubscriptionKey 'qna-subscription-key'
    ```
