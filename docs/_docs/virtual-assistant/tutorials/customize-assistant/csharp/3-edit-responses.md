## Edit your responses

Each dialog within your assistant contains a set of responses stored in supporting Language Generation (`.lg`) files. You can edit the responses directly in the file to modify how your assistant responds. Learn more about the Language Generation template syntax [here](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/master/experimental/language-generation/docs/lg-file-format.md).

This approach supports multi-lingual responses by providing alternate .lg files for different languages (e.g. "MyResponses.de-de.lg").
