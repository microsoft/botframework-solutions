## Deploy your assistant

The Virtual Assistant requires the following Azure dependencies to run correctly. These are created through an [ARM (Azure Resource Manager)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/resource-manager/) script (you can modify this to meet your requirements).

- Azure Web App
- Azure Storage Account (Transcripts)
- Azure Application Insights (Telemetry)
- Azure CosmosDb (State)
- Azure Cognitive Services - Language Understanding
- Azure Cognitive Services - QnAMaker (including Azure Search, Azure Web App)

> Review the pricing and terms for the services and adjust to suit your scenario.
