## Configuration
### Deployment
Learn how to [provision your Azure resources]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/csharp/create-skill/4_provision_your_azure_resources/) in the Create a Skill tutorial.

### Supported content providers
> Office 365 and Outlook.com through the Microsoft Graph is supported along with support for Google accounts.

To use Google account skill you need follow these steps:
1. Create your calendar API credential in [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com). 
2. Create an OAuth connection setting in your Web App Bot.
    - Connection name: `googleapi`
    - Service Provider: `Google`
    - Client id and secret are generated in step 1
    - Scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts`.
3. Add the connection name, client id, secret and scopes in the `appsetting.json` file.

### Authentication connection Settings
If you plan to use the skill as part of a Virtual Assistant the process of registering a skill with your Virtual Assistant will create the supporting authentication connection information automatically for your Virtual Assistant. This skill uses the following authentication scopes which are registered automatically:
- `User.ReadBasic.All`
- `Mail.ReadWrite`
- `Mail.Send`
- `People.Read`
- `Contacts.Read`

**However**, if you wish to use the Skill directly without using a Virtual Assistant please use the following steps to manually configure Authentication for the Calendar Skill. This is **not** required when using the Skill with a Virtual Assistant.

Follow the general instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/howto/skills/manualauthsteps) to configure this using the scopes shown above.

## Events
