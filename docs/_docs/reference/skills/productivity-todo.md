## Configuration
### Deployment
Learn how to [provision your Azure resources]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/csharp/create-skill/4_provision_your_azure_resources/) in the Create a Skill tutorial.

### Supported content providers
> Office 365 and Outlook.com through the Microsoft Graph is supported at this time.

### Authentication connection settings
If you plan to use the skill as part of a Virtual Assistant the process of registering a skill with your Virtual Assistant will create the supporting authentication connection information automatically for your Virtual Assistant. This skill uses the following authentication scopes which are registered automatically:
- `Notes.ReadWrite` 
- `User.ReadBasic.All`
- `Tasks.ReadWrite`

**However**, if you wish to use the Skill directly without using a Virtual Assistant please use the following steps to manually configure Authentication for the Calendar Skill. This is **not** required when using the Skill with a Virtual Assistant.

Follow the general instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/howto/skills/manualauthsteps) to configure this using the scopes shown above.

### Add customized to do lists
If you want to add your customized list types, for example, your homework list or movie list, please follow these steps:

1. Add your list type to `appsettings.json`

```json
"customizeListTypes": [
    "Homework",
    "Movie"
  ]
```

2.Add your list type name and its synonym in `Responses/Shared/ToDoString.resx`

Name | Value |
---- | ----- |
Homework | Homework |
HomeworkSynonym | homework, home work |

1. Modify your LUIS file. Modify `Deployment/Resources/LU/en/todo.lu` so that your LUIS app can tell these new ListType entities. You can provide more utterance to make your LUIS model perform better.

```diff
## AddToDo
+ - add {TaskContent=History} to my {ListType=homework} list
+ - add {TaskContent=Math} to my {ListType=homework}
```

(Optional) If you want to support multiple languages, please modify corresponding `.resx` files and `.lu` files, such as `Deployment/Resources/LU/zh/todo.lu`.

```diff
## AddToDo
+ - 在{ListType=作业}列表里加上{TaskContent=数学}
```

(Optional) After you add new list type, you can modify prompts as needed to make your conversation more friendly. For example, you can modify `Responses/Main/ToDoMainResponses.json`:

```diff
"ToDoWelcomeMessage": {
    "replies": [
      {
+       "text": "Hi. I'm To Do bot. I can help you manage your To Do, Shopping, Grocery or Homework list."
-       "text": "Hi. I'm To Do bot. I can help you manage your To Do, Shopping or Grocery list."
      }
    ]
```

1. Redeploy your To Do Skill.
