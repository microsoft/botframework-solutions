### Authentication connection settings
> No authentication is required for this skill

## Events
Learn how to use [events]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/virtual-assistant/events) to send backend data to a Skill, like a user's location.

### From assistant to user
This Skill supports an outgoing `OpenDefaultApp` Event Activity that provides a Geo URI for chat clients to determine how to handle navigation to a user's selected point of interest.
The [Virtual Assistant Client (Android) sample]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/samples/vaclient_android/) demonstrates how a client may navigate to a destination using a user's preferred map application.

```json
{ 
   "type":"event",
   "name":"OpenDefaultApp",
   "value":{ 
      "GeoUri":"geo:{LONGITUDE},{LATITUDE}"
   }
}
```
