## Overview

These experimental Bot Framework Skills are early prototypes to help bring skill concepts to life for demonstrations and proof-of-concepts along with providing different examples to get you started.

These skills by their very nature are not complete, will likely have rudimentary language models, limited language support and limited testing hence are located in a experimental folder to ensure this is understood before you make use of them.

### Skill Deployment

The Experimental Skills require the following dependencies for end to end operation which are created through an ARM script which you can modify as required.

- Azure Web App
- Azure Storage Account (Transcripts)
- Azure Application Insights (Telemetry)
- Azure CosmosDb (State)
- Azure Cognitive Services - Language Understanding

> Review the pricing and terms for the services and adjust to suit your scenario.

**To deploy the experimental skills using the default configuration, follow the steps in this common [deployment documentation page]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/csharp/create-assistant/4_provision_your_azure_resources) from the folder where your have cloned the GitHub repo.**

### Hospitality Skill

The [Hospitality Skill]({{site.repo}}/tree/master/skills/src/csharp/experimental/hospitalityskill) demonstrates experiences that would be useful in a hospitality specific scenario, such as being able to check out of a hotel, ordering room service, and requesting hotel amenities. This skill does not integrate a hotel service at this time, and is instead simulated with static data for testing purposes.

This skill demonstrates the following scenarios:
- Show reservation: *What is my current check out date?*
- Extend reservation: *Can I extend my stay?*
- Request late check-out: *I want a late check out time* 
- Request amenities: *Can you bring me a toothbrush and toothpaste?*
- Room service: *I want to see a room service menu*
- Check out: *Can I check out now?*
