## Response Files
To configure responses for your skill project, you'll need a .json file and a text template file (.tt) for each collection of responses. An example of each can be found in the Skill Template project in the Responses folder.

### Json Structure
Responses can be stored in the following format to be used in your project. Each .json file should have a Build Action of **EmbeddedResource** to be loaded properly at runtime. 
```
"templateName": {
    "replies": [
        {
            "text": "Welcome to my bot, {Name}!",
            "speak": "Welcome, {Name}!"
        }
    ],
    "suggestedActions": [
      "Help"
    ],
    "inputHint": "acceptingInput"
}
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| templateName | The name used to call the template |
| replies | The collection of replies. A random reply will be selected when called |
| text  | The text that will be shown in the response. Tokens denoted with `{}` can be replaced by the [Response Manager](#response-manager). |
| speak | The text that will be spoken with the response. Tokens denoted with `{}` can be replaced by the [Response Manager](#response-manager). |
| inputHint | Indicates mic configuration for the response. Values are *acceptingInput* (default), *expectingInput* (for prompts), *ignoringInput* (intermediate responses)|
| suggestedActions (optional) | Sets simple suggestedActions on the response. |

#### Localization
To provide localized versions of responses, add additional .json files for each language. The file name format should be name.locale.json (e.g. `MyResponses.de.json`).


### Text Template
The text template (.tt) file auto-generates a class representing the names of the responses in the .json file. This allows you to reference the responses names more easily. The text template and .json files should have the same root name and be in the same folder (e.g. `MyResponses.tt` and `MyResponses.json`).

```csharp
namespace SkillSample.Responses.Sample
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Contains bot responses.
    /// </summary>
    public class SampleResponses : IResponseIdCollection
    {
        // Generated accessors
        public const string NamePrompt = "NamePrompt";
        public const string HaveNameMessage = "HaveNameMessage";
    }
}
```

## Adaptive Cards
Adaptive cards can be added in .json format to the Content folder to be accessed throughout your project. Each .json file should have a Build Action of EmbeddedResource to be loaded properly at runtime. 

### Card Object

Adaptive cards are referenced via the Card type. To create a Card object from the Adaptive Card *MyCard.json*, use the following code:

```csharp
new Card("MyCard")
```

### ICardData Interface
The ICardData interface is used to replace tokens in your Adaptive Card. This allows you to provide different values into different containers in your card.

If *MyCard.json* contains that following Adaptive TextBlock:
```json
{
    "type": "TextBlock",
    "text": "{Name}",
    "weight": "bolder",
    "wrap": true
}
```

Given the following ICardData implementation:

```csharp
public class MyCardData : ICardData
{
    public MyCardData(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
The following will generate a card that replaces the `{Name}` token with the provided value, "Jane".
```csharp
new Card("MyCard", new MyCardData("Jane"))
```

## Response Manager
The ResponseManager class loads each response file that is specified into a collection of responses for your bot. It is initialized in Startup.cs and can be used throughout the project.

## Initalizing the ResponseManager
In Startup.cs, the following code initalizes your ResponseManager object with the specified locales and your response files:

```csharp
    // Configure responses
    services.AddSingleton(sp => new ResponseManager(
        new[] { "en", "de", "es" }, // array of supported locales
        new MainResponses(), // Auto-generated object created by text template
        new SharedResponses(),
        new SampleResponses()));
```

## Using the ResponseManager
Once you have created your .json and .tt files and initalized your ResponseManager in Startup.cs, you can use the respnse manager to build your responses. The following methods and overloads are available to you.

### GetResponse()

- Get a simple response from template with Text, Speak, InputHint, and SuggestedActions set.

    ```csharp
        GetResponse(
            string templateId,

    ```
    
    | Parameter | Description |
    | --------- | ----------- |
    | templateId | The name of the response template. |
    | tokens | StringDictionary of tokens to replace in the response. |

### GetCardResponse()

    ```csharp
    GetCardResponse(Card card)
    ```

    | Parameter | Description |
