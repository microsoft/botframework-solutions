# Tutorial: Enable Speech for your Assistant

## Add the Speech Channel to your Assistant

The first step is to add the Direct-Line Speech Channel to your deployed Assistant.

1. Go to the Azure Portal and locate the Web App Bot created for your Assistant which is most easily found by opening the Resource Group.
2. Click `Channels` on the left-hand navigation and select `Direct Line Speech`
3. Review the Channel introduction page and when ready, click `Save` to add the Channel to your Assistant.
4. Retrieve the **Channel secret** key which will be used by your application to connect to your Bot through the Direct Line Speech Channel and store this ready for later in this tutorial.
