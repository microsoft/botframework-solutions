## Scenario Configurations
In dialogs such as `Create Meeting`, the user needs to provide information such as title and meeting content before able to create a meeting. Depending on the user context (e.g. Speech driven and whilst driving) you can configure default slot-filling to minimise the number of questions - e.g. `Schedule a project review meeting with alex tomorrow at 8pm` would create the meeting with a default length of 30 minutes and no meeting contents.

This behaviour can be configured in the Skill `appsettings.json` by setting `isSkipByDefault` to true, and modify `EventTitle`, `EventContent` and `EventLocation` default values in `CalendarCommonStrings.resx` to set default value of different locales.

The `EventStartDate` default value should be a integer that means date difference with today. For example, if you want to set default start date as next day of meeting created date, the default value should be `1`.

The `EventDuration` default value is the default duration expressed in minutes (number).
 
```json
"defaultValue": {
    "createMeeting": [
        {
            "name": "EventTitle",
            "isSkipByDefault": false
        },
        {
            "name": "EventContent",
            "isSkipByDefault": false
        },
        {
            "name": "EventStartDate",
            "isSkipByDefault": false,
            "defaultValue": ""
        },
        {
            "name": "EventDuration",
            "isSkipByDefault": false,
            "defaultValue": ""
        },
        {
            "name": "EventLocation",
            "isSkipByDefault": false
        }
    ]
}
```
  
## Skill Deployment

The Calendar Skill require the following dependencies for end to end operation which are created through an ARM deployment script which you can modify as required.

- Azure Web App
- Azure Storage Account (Transcripts)
- Azure Application Insights (Telemetry)
- Azure CosmosDb (State)
- Azure Cognitive Services - Language Understanding

> Review the pricing and terms for the services and adjust to suit your scenario.

**To deploy your services using the default configuration, follow the steps in this common [deployment documentation page](/docs/tutorials/assistantandskilldeploymentsteps.md) from the folder where your have cloned the GitHub repo.**

### Authentication Connection Settings

If you plan to use the skill as part of a Virtual Assistant the process of registering a skill with your Virtual Assistant will create the supporting authentication connection information automatically for your Virtual Assistant. This skill uses the following authentication scopes which are registered automatically:

- `User.ReadBasic.All`  
- `Calendars.ReadWrite`
- `People.Read`    
- `Contacts.Read`
- `User.Read.All`

**However**, if you wish to use the Skill directly without using a Virtual Assistant please use the following steps to manually configure Authentication for the Calendar Skill. This is **not** required when using the Skill with a Virtual Assistant.

Follow the general instructions [here](/docs/reference/skills/manualauthsteps.md) to configure this using the scopes shown above.
