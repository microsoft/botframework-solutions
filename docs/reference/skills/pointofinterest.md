## Event Responses

The Point of Interest Skill surfaces a users request to navigate to a new destination through an event returned to the client. The event is called `ActiveRoute.Directions" has contains a series of Points for the Route along with a summary of the route information. A simplified example is shown below

```json
{
  "name": "ActiveRoute.Directions",
  "type": "event",
  "value": [
    {
      "points": [
        {
          "latitude": 47.64056,
          "longitude": -122.129372
        },
        {
          "latitude": 47.64053,
          "longitude": -122.129387
        },

        ...

      ],
      "summary": {
        "arrivalTime": "2018-09-18T04:17:25Z",
        "departureTime": "2018-09-18T03:54:35Z",
        "lengthInMeters": 20742,
        "trafficDelayInSeconds": 0,
        "travelTimeInSeconds": 1370
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

### Supported Sources

> **Mandatory**: [Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-maps/) is supported for finding Points of Interest and getting route directions to a selected location.
> As this is the only supported provider to get directions, this provider is required.

> [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api) is supported for finding Points of Interest and related details (rating, business hours, price level, etc.).

### Auth Connection Settings

> No Authentication is required for this skill

### Skill Parameters

The following Parameters are accepted by the Skill and enable additional personalization of responses to a given user:

- `IPA.Location` (*The skill will fail without this as it is missing a user's current coordinates*)
- To ease testing scenarios you can send the following message to pass a location enabling you to test the POI skill and adjust the location
  - `/event:{ "Name": "IPA.Location", "Value": "34.05222222222222,-118.24277777777778" }`

Read [Handling Events With Your Virtual Assistant](../../virtual-assistant/csharp/events.md) to learn how to manage events within a Skill.

### Configuration File Information

The following Configuration entries are required to be passed to the Skill and are provided through the Virtual Assistant appSettings.json file. These should be updated to reflect your LUIS deployment.

- `LuisAppId`
- `LuisSubscriptionKey`
- `LuisEndpoint`
- `AzureMapsKey`
- `FoursquareClientId` *(optional)*
- `FoursquareClientSecret` *(optional)*
- `ImageAssetLocation`
- `Radius` *(in meters)*
- `LimitSize`

### Example Skill Registration Entry

```json
{
    "Name": "PointOfInterest",
    "DispatcherModelName": "l_PointOfInterest",
    "Description": "The Point of Interest Skill adds PoI related capabilities to your Custom Assitant",
    "Assembly": "PointOfInterestSkill.PointOfInterestSkill, PointOfInterestSkill, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral",
    "AuthConnectionName": "",
    "Parameters": [
    "IPA.Timezone"
    ],
    "Configuration": {
    "LuisAppId": "YOUR_LUIS_APP_ID",
    "LuisSubscriptionKey": "YOUR_LUIS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY",
    "LuisEndpoint": "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/"
    "AzureMapsKey": "YOUR_AZURE_MAPS_KEY",
    "FoursquareClientId": "YOUR_FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID",
    "FoursquareClientSecret": "YOUR_FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "Radius": "SEARCH_RADIUS_FROM_LOCATION",
    "ImageAssetLocation": "http://www.contoso.com/images/",
    "LimitSize": "POI_SEARCH_LIMIT"
    }
}
```

### Image Assets

In order for Adaptive Cards to render images associated with the Point of Interest skill you will need to take the image assets located in the wwwroot\images folder of the PointOfInterestSkill project and place in a HTTP location (potentially your Bot deployment) and place the base URI path in the skill configuration ImageAssetLocation property.
If you skip this step, Adaptive Cards will not render with images correctly.

### Deploying the Skill in local-mode

The Point of Interest skill is added by default when deploying the Virtual Assistant, however if you want to install as a standalone bot for development/testing following the steps below.

Run this PowerShell script from the Point of Interest skill directory to deploy shared resources and LUIS models.

```
  pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File DeploymentScripts\deploy_bot.ps1
```

You will be prompted to provide the following parameters:

- Name - A name for your bot and resource group. This must be **unique**.
- Location - The Azure region for your services (e.g. westus)
- LUIS Authoring Key - Refer to [this documentation page](../../virtual-assistant/csharp/gettingstarted.md) for retrieving this key.

The MSBot tool will outline the deployment plan including location and SKU. Ensure you review before proceeding.

> After deployment is complete, it's **imperative** that you make a note of the .bot file secret provided as this will be required for later steps. The secret can be found near the top of the execution output and will be in purple text.

- Update your `appsettings.json` file with the newly created .bot file name and .bot file secret.
- Run the following command and retrieve the InstrumentationKey for your Application Insights instance and update `InstrumentationKey` in your `appsettings.json` file.

```
msbot list --bot YOURBOTFILE.bot --secret YOUR_BOT_SECRET
```

```json
  {
    "botFilePath": ".\\YOURBOTFILE.bot",
    "botFileSecret": "YOUR_BOT_SECRET",
    "ApplicationInsights": {
      "InstrumentationKey": "YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY"
    }
  }
```

- Finally, add the .bot file paths for each of your language configurations

```json
"defaultLocale": "en-us",
  "languageModels": {
    "en": {
      "botFilePath": ".\\LocaleConfigurations\\YOUR_EN_BOT_PATH.bot",
      "botFileSecret": ""
    }
    }
```

Once you have followed the deployment instructions above, open the provided .bot file with the Bot Framework Emulator.
