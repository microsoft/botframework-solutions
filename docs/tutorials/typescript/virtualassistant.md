## Intro

### Purpose

Install Bot Framework development prerequisites and create your first Virtual Assistant.

### Prerequisites

[Download and install](#download-and-install) the Bot Framework development prerequisites.

* Retrieve your LUIS Authoring Key
  - Review the [LUIS regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions) documentation page for the correct LUIS portal for the region you plan to deploy to. Note that www.luis.ai refers to the US region and an authoring key retrieved from this portal will not work within a Europe deployment. 
  - Once signed in, click on your name in the top right hand corner.
  - Choose Settings and make a note of the Authoring Key for the next step.

### Time to Complete

10 minutes

### Scenario

A Virtual Assistant app (in TypeScript) that greets a new user.

## Download and install

> It's important to ensure all of the following prerequisites are installed on your machine prior to attempting deployment, otherwise you may run into deployment issues.

1. Download and install the [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Download and install PowerShell Core version 6 (required for cross platform deployment support).

    * [Download PowerShell Core on Windows](https://aka.ms/getps6-windows)
    * [Download PowerShell Core on macOS and Linux](https://aka.ms/getps6-linux)

3. Download and install Bot Framework (CLI) tool dependencies. It's important to do this even if you have earlier versions because the Virtual Assistant makes use of the latest capabilities: 

   ```shell
   npm install -g botdispatch ludown luis-apis qnamaker luisgen@2.0.2
   ```

4. Install Botskills (CLI) tool:
   
   ```
   npm install -g botskills
   ```

5. Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)

   ```shell
   npm install -g yo
   ```

6. Install the [Azure Command Line Tools (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Create your assistant

Install the botbuilder-assistant generator

```bash
    npm install -g generator-botbuilder-assistant
```

Now you can execute the Virtual Assistant generator with this command.

```bash
yo botbuilder-assistant
```

**At this point you can proceed with two different options:**

### Generate the assistant using prompts

- The generator will start prompting for some information that is needed for generating the sample:
  - `What's the name of your assistant? (customAssistant)`
        > The name of your assistant (also used as your project's name and for the root folder's name).
    - `What's the description of your assistant? ()`
        > The description of your assistant.
    - `Which languages will your assistant use? (by default takes all the languages)`
      - [x] Chinese (`zh`)
      - [x] Deutsch (`de`)
      - [x] English (`en`)
      - [x] French (`fr`)
      - [x] Italian (`it`)
      - [x] Spanish (`es`)
    - `Do you want to change the new assistant's location?`
        > A confirmation to change the destination for the generation.
    - `Where do you want to generate the assistant? (By default, it takes the path where you are running the generator)`
      > The destination path for the generation.
    - `Looking good. Shall I go ahead and create your new assistant?`
        > Final confirmation for creating the desired assistant.

### Generate the sample using CLI parameters

| Option                            | Description                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -n, --assistantName <name>              | name of new assistant (by default takes `customAssistant`)                                                          |
| -d, --assistantDesc <description>       | description of the new assistant (by default is empty) |
| -l, --assistantLang <array of languages>| languages for the new assistant. Possible values are `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `it`, `zh` (by default takes all the languages)|
| -p, --assistantGenerationPath <path>    | destination path for the new assistant (by default takes the path where you are running the generator)            |
| --noPrompt                        | indicates to avoid the prompts                                                                               |

**NOTE:** If you don't use the _--noPrompt_ option, the process will keep prompting, but will still be using the input values by default.

#### Example

```bash
> yo botbuilder-assistant -n "Virtual Assistant" -d "A description for my new assistant" -l "en,es" -p "\aPath" --noPrompt
```

After this, you can check the summary on your screen:

```bash
- Name: <aName>
- Description: <aDescription>
- Selected languages: <languages>
- Path: <aPath>
```

>**WARNING:** The process will fail if it finds another folder with the same name of the new assistant.

>**NOTE:** Remember to have an **unique** assistant's name for deployment steps.

You now have your own Virtual Assistant! Before trying to run your assistant locally, continue with the deployment steps (it creates vital dependencies required to run correctly).

## Deploy your assistant

The Virtual Assistant requires the following Azure dependencies to run correctly. These are created through an [ARM (Azure Resource Manager)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/resource-manager/) script (you can modify this to meet your requirements).

- Azure Web App
- Azure Storage Account (Transcripts)
- Azure Application Insights (Telemetry)
- Azure CosmosDb (State)
- Azure Cognitive Services - Language Understanding
- Azure Cognitive Services - QnAMaker (including Azure Search, Azure Web App)

> Review the pricing and terms for the services and adjust to suit your scenario.

1. Run **PowerShell Core** (pwsh.exe) and **change directory to the project directory** of your assistant/skill.
2. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    .\Deployment\Scripts\deploy.ps1
    ```

    ### What do these parameters mean?

    Parameter | Description | Required
    --------- | ----------- | --------
    `name` | **Unique** name for your bot. By default this name will be used as the base name for all your Azure Resources and must be unique across Azure so make sure your prefix is something unique and **not** *MyAssistant* | **Yes**
    `location` | The region for your Azure Resources. By default, this will be the location for all your Azure Resources | **Yes**
    `appPassword` | The password for the [Azure Active Directory App](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) that will be used by your bot. It must be at least 16 characters long, contain at least 1 special character, and contain at least 1 numeric character. If using an existing app, this must be the existing password. | **Yes**
    `luisAuthoringKey` | The authoring key for your LUIS account. It can be found at https://www.luis.ai/user/settings or https://eu.luis.ai/user/settings | **Yes**

You can find more detailed deployment steps including customization on the [Virtual Assistant and Skill Template deployment](/docs/tutorials/assistantandskilldeploymentsteps.md) page.

## Run your assistant

When deployment is complete, you can run your Virtual Assistant through the following steps:

1. Open the generated assistant in your desired IDE (e.g Visual Studio Code).
2. Run `npm run start`.
3. Run the **Bot Framework Emulator**.
4. Select **Open Bot**.

  </p>

5. Populate the fields in the **Open a Bot** modal with your bot's configuration settings. Provide the endpoint of your running bot, e.g: `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`. Provide the AppId and Secret values. Find these in your `appsettings.json` file, under the `microsoftAppId` and `microsoftAppPassword` configuration settings.
