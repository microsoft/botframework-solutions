# Bot Builder Enterprise Dialog Generator

## Generate dialog

- Open a terminal in the desired folder for generating the dialog.
- Run the following command for generating your new component.

```bash
> yo botbuilder-enterprise:dialog
```
#### **At this point you have two different options to procedure**

### Generate the sample using prompts

- The generator will start prompting for some information that is needed for generating the dialog:
    - `What's the name of your dialog? (custom)`
        > The name of your dialog (used also as the root folder's name).
    - `Do you want to change the location of the generation?`
        > A confirmation to change the destination for the generation.
        - `Where do you want to generate the dialog? (by default takes the path where you are running the generator)`
            > The destination path for the generation.
    - `Looking good. Shall i go ahead and create your new dialog?`
        > Final confirmation for creating the desired dialog.

### Generate the dialog using CLI parameters


| Option                               | Description                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -n, --dialogName <name>              | name of new dialog (by default takes `custom`)                                                               |
| -p, --dialogGenerationPath <path>    | destination path for the new dialog (by default takes the path where you are runnning the generator)         |
| --noPrompt                           | indicates to avoid the prompts                                                                               |

**NOTE:** If you don't use the _--noPrompt_ option, the process will keep prompting, but using the input values by default.

#### Example

```bash
> yo botbuilder-enterprise:dialog -n newDialog -p "\aPath" --noPrompt
```

After this, you can check the summary in your screen:

```bash
- Folder: <aDialogFolder>
- Dialog file: <aDialogFile> (with .ts extension)
- Responses file: <aResponsesFile> (with .ts extension)
- Path: <aPath>
```

## How to use it
After using the generator, you have available two different files, one for Dialog itself and other for Responses.

> NOTE: The following examples are based on a bot created using the Enterprise Bot Template.

### Adding Dialog file

To link your dialog into a bot 

```typescript
export class aBot {
    private readonly DIALOGS: DialogSet;

    constructor(dialogSet: DialogSet) {
        this.DIALOGS = dialogSet;
        this.DIALOGS.add(new <dialogName>());
    }
    
    public async onTurn(turnContext: TurnContext): Promise<void> {
        const dc: DialogContext = await this.DIALOGS.createContext(turnContext);
        const result: DialogTurnResult<any> = await dc.continueDialog();

        if (result.status === DialogTurnStatus.empty) {
            await dc.beginDialog('<dialogName>');
        }
    }
}
```

### Using Responses file
You can configure the responses for the language that you have selected to deploy your bot.\
First, open the locale file for the language selected in the generator (eg. `locales/en.json`) and add a new key to identify your dialog, and inside another one with the value for your response.\
For this, go to your responses file created and add the response you want like below.
```typescript
public static RESPONSE_IDS: {
    <keyName>: string;
} = {
    <keyName>: '<keyName>'
};

private static readonly RESPONSE_TEMPLATES: LanguageTemplateDictionary = new Map([
    ['default', new Map([
        [<responsesClassName>.RESPONSE_IDS.<keyName>, <responsesClassName>.fromResources('<responsesClassName>.<keyName>')]
    ])]
])
```
