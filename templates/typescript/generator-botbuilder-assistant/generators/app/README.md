# Bot Builder Assistant Generator

## Generate assistant

- Open a terminal in the desired folder for generating the assistant.
- Run the following command for generating your new project.

```bash
> yo botbuilder-assistant
```

#### **At this point you have two different options to procedure**

### Generate the assistant using prompts

- The generator will start prompting for some information that is needed for generating the sample:
    - `What's the name of your assistant? (sample-assistant)`
        > The name of your assistant (used also as your project's name and for the root folder's name).
    - `What will your assistant do? ()`
        > The description of your assistant.
    - `Which languages will your assistant use? (by default takes all the languages)`
        - [x] Chinese (`zh-cn`)
        - [x] Deutsch (`de-de`)
        - [x] English (`en-us`)
        - [x] French (`fr-fr`)
        - [x] Italian (`it-it`)
        - [x] Spanish (`es-es`)
    - `Do you want to change the new assistant's location?`
        > A confirmation to change the destination for the generation.
        - `Where do you want to generate the assistant? (by default takes the path where you are running the generator)`
            > The destination path for the generation.
    - `Looking good. Shall I go ahead and create your new assistant?`
        > Final confirmation for creating the desired assistant.

### Generate the sample using CLI parameters

| Option                            | Description                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -n, --assistantName [name]              | name of new assistant (by default takes `sample-assistant`)                                                          |
| -d, --assistantDesc [description]       | description of the new assistant (by default takes ``) |
| -l, --assistantLang [languages]| languages for the new assistant. Possible values are `de-de`, `en-us`, `es-es`, `fr-fr`, `it-it`, `zh-cn` (by default takes all the languages)| 
| -p, --assistantGenerationPath [path]    | destination path for the new assistant (by default takes the path where you are runnning the generator)            |
| --noPrompt                        | indicates to avoid the prompts                                                                               |

**NOTE:** If you don't use the _--noPrompt_ option, the process will keep prompting, but using the input values by default.

#### Example

```bash
> yo botbuilder-assistant -n "Virtual Assistant" -d "A description for my new assistant" -l "en-us,es-es" -p "\aPath" --noPrompt
```

After this, you can check the summary in your screen:
```bash
- Name: <aName>
- Description: <aDescription>
- Selected languages: <languages>
- Path: <aPath>
```

**WARNING:** The process will fail if it finds another folder with the same name of the new assistant.

**NOTE:** Remind to have an **unique** assistant's name for deployment steps. 

**NOTE:** After generating your sample, you can check its README for more information on how to deploy and test it. You can find it in the root folder of your newly created sample or [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/AI/blob/master/docs/virtual-assistant/src/typescript/gettingstarted.md).
