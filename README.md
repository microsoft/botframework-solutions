|[<img src="./docs/media/calendarskillcardexample.png" width="1250">**Skills**](/docs/readme.md)|Developers can compose conversational experiences by stitching together re-usable conversational capabilities, known as Skills.

Skills include LUIS models, Dialogs and Integration code and delivered in source code form enabling you to customise and extend as required. At this time we provide Calendar, Email, ToDo, Point of Interest skills and a number of other experimental skills. |
