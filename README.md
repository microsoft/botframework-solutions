Enterprise Template | The creation of a high quality conversational experience requires a foundational set of capabilities. To help you succeed with building great conversational experiences, we have created an Enterprise Bot Template. <br /> <br />This template brings together all of the best practices and supporting components we've identified through building conversational experiences and greatly simplifies the creation of a new bot project including: basic conversational intents, Dispatcher integration, QnA Maker, Application Insights, Power BI insights and an automated deployment. | [Get Started](./templates/Enterprise-Template/README.md)
